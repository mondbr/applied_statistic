Applied Statistic repository

by Monika Dabrowska

This repository is for the the practical assignments for the Applied Statistics module in the Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course at [ATU](https://www.atu.ie/) in the winter semester of 2025/26.



My work is presented in a [Jupyter Notebook](https://domino.ai/data-science-dictionary/jupyter-notebook) and focuses on analysing statistical problems using [Python](https://www.python.org/doc/essays/blurb/), [NumPy](https://numpy.org/). 


The purpose of this module is to demonstrate my ability to: 
* Describe the **stochastic nature** of real-world measurements.
* Source documentation to **programmatically perform a statistical test**.
* **Select an appropriate statistical test** to investigate a claim.
* Perform a **statistical test** on a data set.
